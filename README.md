### Envato Tuts+ Course: Getting Started With Foundation Building Blocks
#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/adi-purdila)

The Foundation Building Blocks are coded UI components that can be used in any Foundation project. They are not replacements for the default Foundation components, but supplements. 

In this course you’ll learn how to install these blocks and also how to build a simple UI by using components made by both Zurb and the community.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from June, 2017**
